# Headline Generation and Summarization of News Articles with T5 and XSum Dataset

## Overview

This project implements a headline summarization pipeline using the T5 transformer model fine-tuned on the XSum dataset. It provides a user-friendly interface using Gradio to generate concise summaries for long headlines or paragraphs. The project showcases end-to-end machine learning capabilities, from preprocessing and fine-tuning to deployment with a modern UI.

## Features

- Fine-tuned T5 transformer model for high-quality text summarization.

- Preprocessing pipeline for efficient dataset preparation.

- Integrated Gradio interface for real-time summarization.

- Modular code structure for ease of customization and scalability.

- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring.

##  Setup Instructions

###  Prerequisites
```plaintext
Python 3.8 or higher

Pip or Conda for package management
```

### Installation

#### Clone the repository:
```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/headline-summarization.git
cd headline-summarization
```
#### Create a virtual environment:
```plaintext
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate    # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```
#### Install dependencies:
```plaintext
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Download the XSum dataset and preprocess it:
```plaintext
python data/xsum_dataset.py
```
#### Fine-tune the T5 model (optional):
```plaintext
python models/t5_model.py
```
#### Run the Gradio app:
```plaintext
python app/app.py
```
## Usage

#### Fine-Tuning the Model:
- Modify the t5_model.py script to adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Execute the script to fine-tune the model on the XSum dataset.

#### Launching the Gradio App:
- Run app.py to start the Gradio-based summarization tool locally. Access it at http://localhost:7860.

#### Customization:
- Modify the tokenizer.py and metrics.py scripts in the utils folder to adjust tokenization or add custom evaluation metrics.

## Key Components

##### 1. Data Preprocessing
```plaintext 
Script: data/xsum_dataset.py
```
Highlights: Efficiently preprocesses the XSum dataset and prepares it for training using Hugging Face's datasets library.

##### 2. Fine-Tuning
```plaintext
Script: models/t5_model.py
```
Highlights: Implements fine-tuning for the T5 model with options for checkpointing and logging.

##### 3. Gradio Deployment
```plaintext
Script: app/app.py
```
Highlights: Deploys the model with a simple Gradio interface for real-time summarization.
